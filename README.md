# BookStore Chatbot (RAG + FastAPI + MySQL + Chroma)

This is a minimal, production-minded reference implementation for a BookStore chatbot with:
- RAG-based catalog search (Hybrid: MySQL FULLTEXT + Vector via Chroma)
- Order flow with slot-filling (state machine), confirmation, and Admin approval
- Admin dashboard for Books (CRUD) + Orders (Pending/Approved/Cancelled)
- WebSocket notifications to the chat when Admin approves/cancels
